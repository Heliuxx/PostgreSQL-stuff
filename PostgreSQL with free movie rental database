PostgreSQL query where I was messing around with a free database regarding rentals at a film store.  Was looking for people in particular that would
tend to spend more than the average amount spent throughout all customers.  I wanted to find which country's customers tended to spend more.

select first_name||' '||last_name as name, customer.customer_id, city, country
	from address
inner join city on address.city_id = city.city_id
inner join customer on address.address_id = customer.address_id
inner join payment on customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
inner join country on country.country_id = city.country_id
		where payment.amount > (
			select avg(amount)
			from payment
)
		--and country = 'United States'
    --and country like 'Russian%'
group by first_name||' '||last_name, customer.customer_id, city, country
order by country;
